What\'s new in Series 4

The old features of Xortify will remain; the 3 month honey-pot ban as well as other details. We will be adding a system similar to a virus scanner but for spam; this will work like the heuristic system much like a virus scanner, when an Editor Object, Text Area or DHTML XOOPS Form object passes data to your portal - Xortify will pick this up in the preloader system of XOOPS and check the content via the cloud for traits of SPAM.

The statistics (Which we only started tracking in 2014) are available publically which you will find listed in the popular perl application awstats. If you want to view the statistics just goto here: https://xortify.com/awstats/awstats.pl

Although the cloud services are not finished yet for this; the components\' of it has been written into the client so you will be right to install XOOPS Xortify Client for XOOPS 2.5 or XOOPS 2.6 and be well knowing that within a number of weeks, you system will be checking for SPAM heuristics.

There is a few new functions on the API these include:

    spoofcomment – Production of a trick comment box
    spoofregistration – Production of a trick registration form
    spoofthread – Production of a trick thread form
    training – For sending ham/spam for training the API.

A bit about Xortify!

Xortify was developed in response to attacks on websites from rouge malicious bots, spam and captcha sweatshop, spam slavery as well as other forms of abuse of our clients systems. We have been able to stop close to 99% of spam and captcha attacks with the Xortify client. Believe it or not Xoritfy is also in response to human rights abuse on the web, such as captcha and spam sweat shops where individuals are paid less than 1 USD a day to set up accounts for bots to spam website by typing past captcha puzzles as well as sometimes they are even slaves.

Originally Xortify started out as a demo of the API X-JSON, X-CURL and X-SOAP for XOOPS 2 series and became a revolution in security for the XOOPS Platform. XOOPS comes with an application called Protector which prevents hacks and attacks to users of XOOPS and maintains a local ban list. This ban list is known as a bad IP that is an IP Address which has attacked by trying to cause for example a DOS (Denial of Service/F5 Attack), ingested unions and other forms of attack which protector by GIJOE from PEAK XOOPS - Support&Experiment in japan works on to prevent mal-users and would be hackers from exploiting the people that love xoops and other platforms. Xortify will syndicate your BadIP list with other peoples using Xortify so this cloud of protection forms in your system.

Xortify is an application or process which first started as a practial application to cloud computing for the XOOPS Community which shares protectors bad IPs with a contingent of end users of the Xortify application and one you have signed up ensures that members share their bad ips in IPv4 or IPv6 for the host or proxy with each other so that we are protected from each others website forensically with protector. Here at http://xortify.com the main Node in the Xortify Cloud we host the current Bad IP List for the community so your website with the Xortify client running is pre-aware of a bad user and announces to them on all pages that they are banned unless the ban is cleared with one of our forms.

To be a contributor to the Xortify cloud you will need a username and password which you can sign up for in the software, you only need really one username and password per website or even per webmaster, it it really upto you. We also contribute to Stop Forum Spam as well as using Project Honeypot as a resource and are recieving their ban list as well. A ban is kept for 3 months then automatically removed from the system to ensure truency is in check we also only list a ban really only once not multiple times, sometimes a ban is listed twice when it is causing multiple intrusions on the network but this is a rarity.

Anyone can join Xortify and you don\'t need to use xortify\'s software to maintain, or put additional bans on the framework. If you happen to be a webmaster then you are welcome to view our API Documentation to see how we can intergrate with your environment. We offer wGET, CURL and SOAP api for you use. All you need is a username!!
